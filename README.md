Day-1 
**Task:** Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

<h5>Day-2</h5>
**Task-1:** Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
**Task-2:** Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
**Task-3:** Tip calculator - If the bill was $X, split between  people, with 10,12 0r 15% tip. 

Day-3
**Task-1:** Height measurement ,designed to determine whether a person is eligible to ride a rollercoaster based on their height. It prompts the user to input their height in centimeters and then evaluates the input with a series of conditions.
**Task-2:** Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
**Task-3:** Write a program that, it defines the price of ticket depending on the height and age.If the children height are over 120 and under 18 then price is 7$ otherwise is 12$.
**Task-4:** Write a program that, it defines the price of ticket depending on the height and age.If the children height are over 120 and  age< 12 then price= 5$ ,12<age<=18 then price= 7$, otherwise price is 12$
**Task-5:** Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height. It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value. Under 18.5 they are underweight Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.
**Task-6:** Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 
**Task-7:** Write a program that, it defines the price of ticket depending on the height and age.If the children height are over 120 and  age< 12 then price= 5$ ,12<age<=18 then price= 7$, otherwise price is 12$.If you want aslo photo taken then add +3$
