<h4>Day-2</h4>
<b>Task-1:</b> Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
<b>Task-2:</b> Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
<b>Task-3:</b> Tip calculator - If the bill was $X, split between  people, with 10,12 0r 15% tip. 

<h4>Day-3</h4>
<b>Task-1:</b> Height measurement ,designed to determine whether a person is eligible to ride a rollercoaster based on their height. It prompts the user to input their height in centimeters and then evaluates the input with a series of conditions.
<b>Task-2:</b> Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
<b>Task-3:</b> Write a program that, it defines the price of ticket depending on the height and age.If the children height are over 120 and under 18 then price is 7$ otherwise is 12$.
<b>Task-4:</b> Write a program that, it defines the price of ticket depending on the height and age.If the children height are over 120 and  age< 12 then price= 5$ ,12<age<=18 then price= 7$, otherwise price is 12$.
<b>Task-5:</b> Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height. It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value. Under 18.5 they are underweight Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.
<b>Task-6:</b> Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 
<b>Task-7:</b> Write a program that, it defines the price of ticket depending on the height and age.If the children height are over 120 and  age< 12 then price= 5$ ,12<age<=18 then price= 7$, otherwise price is 12$.If you want aslo photo taken then add +3$
<b>Task-8:</b> You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people. To work out the love score between two people: Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
<b>Task-9:</b> Make your own "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use conditionals such as if, else, and elif statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in your program.

<h4>Day-4</h4>
<b>Task-1:</b> You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number, either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out "Heads" or "Tails".
<b>Task-2:</b> You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
<b>Task-3</b> You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.
<b>Task-4</b> Write a programs -Game Paper,Rock,Scissors

<b>Task-1</b> You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
<b>Task-2</b> You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
<b>Task-3</b> You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to X. If X is 100 then the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100
<b>Task-4</b> You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the odd numbers from 1 to X. If X is 100 then the first odd number would be 1 and the last one is 99
<b>Task-5</b> You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
<b>Task-6</b> You are going to write a program that generates password: easy password and hard password
